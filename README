argosBlock   <----|  testbench  <----- lua
openglBlock	 <----|

you can use both argos or opengl to run the testbench,

the testbench loads an image, finds its tags, and call lua to calc the pos of the tags
after calling lua, it stores the result in a array (in testbench.h), so that argos or opengl can see the results.

argos and opengl call testbench, and use the results to draw 3D items.
